# Transcriptomics Reporting for Disease Risk Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the necessary resources and code to perform whole blood transcriptomics analysis for predicting disease risks. The goal is to leverage gene expression data obtained from whole blood samples to gain insights into the potential risks of developing certain diseases. The analysis pipeline provided here offers a standardized and reproducible approach for performing transcriptomics analysis and generating informative reports.

## Requirements
To use this transcriptomics reporting pipeline, ensure that you have the following software and packages installed:
- Python (version 3.11.3)
- R (version 4.3.0)
- Bioconductor packages: [List the required Bioconductor packages with versions]
- Other dependencies: [List any additional dependencies or software required]

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```shell git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git```

2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the 'Requirements' section.

## Usage

1. Place your whole blood transcriptomics data files in the appropriate directory (data/ or any other designated directory).

2. Modify the configuration file (config.yaml) to specify the input data files, parameters, and other options for the analysis.

3. Run the main analysis script (analysis.py or any other designated script) to perform the transcriptomics analysis using the provided data and configuration.
